# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid with their respective symbols (X and O). The first player to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
